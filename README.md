# Predicting-3pt-Percentage

This project was inspired by the NBA, specifically the NBA future analytics program. I received a coding challenge which dealt with predicting player's three point percentages by the end of the season using a number of variables such as current three point percentage, field goal percentage and mid-range percentage.
For this task, the linear regression model was used and the MSE(Mean Squared Error) was used as the predictive metric .

I created a presentation detailing the code used, the csv file used and outliers that I saw in the results.

Overall, I enjoyed working on this task. I was able to learn about the linear regression model,learn how to create plots using matlab and learn how to update a file.
